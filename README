# "Full Stack Web App" (July 2022)

This is literally just a completely unsecured, very basic web application I made to learn more about full stack development.

The stack of this application is as follows:

FRONTEND:
- Typescript
- Express
- Axios
- HTML/JS/CSS

BACKEND:
- C
- JSON-C
- libcurl
- (Pico)[https://github.com/foxweb/pico]

There has been a lot to the development process. I started development on it roughly 4-5 days or so before father's day of 2022 (as it was initially intended to be a gift to my father).

I'm not exactly sure what to do with this project at the moment, but it sure looks cool I guess.
